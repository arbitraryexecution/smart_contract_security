# Auction Challenge

This auction sends back the ether to the highest bidder after a new highest bidder has emerged. However, there's a vulnerability here. Exploit this vulnerability to stop anyone else from bidding.

**Your task**:

Implement the `blockAuction()` and `fallback()` functions in the `AuctionBlockerAttacker.sol` contract to block the `Auction.sol` contract from receiving any new bids.
